# Sentiment Analysis with PyTorch

A machine learning endeavor designed to ascertain sentiment from textual content, leveraging the prowess of PyTorch.

## Overview

Embarking from raw data to a ready-to-deploy model, the journey encompasses:
- Data preprocessing with renowned Python tools.
- Extracting features from text using state-of-the-art NLP methodologies.
- Crafting, training, and assessing models with PyTorch.
- A primer on deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get the ball rolling, you'd need:
- Python (3.7 or newer)
- PyTorch (1.7 or newer)
- Vital Libraries: pandas, NLTK, torchtext, sklearn

Get all requirements set up with:
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Dataset

Our choice is the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset. Once acquired, it's imperative to position it within a `data/` directory at the project's root.

### Usage

1. **Data Transformation:**
python preprocess.py

2. **Training the Chosen Model:**
python train.py

3. **Model Assessment:**
python evaluate.py


## What Lies Ahead

- Delving into BERT to potentially elevate accuracy.
- Enriching the model to comprehend multiple languages.
- Pondering over real-time analysis integrations.

## How to Contribute

Improvements are always welcomed! Feel free to fork, make your changes, and submit pull requests. For monumental transformations, it's a good idea to start with an issue.

## Licensing

The project proudly adopts the MIT License.

## Acknowledgments

Hearty thanks to IMDb for their invaluable dataset and to the PyTorch community for being an unfailing beacon of resources.
